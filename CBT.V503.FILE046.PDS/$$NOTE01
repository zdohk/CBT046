Hi Sam,

I made a small change to member BACKENDZ in FILE 46 (PACKRAT),
which is in the FILE046.XMI file under my userid.

I replaced these 4 lines:

UCBNEXT  UCBSCAN COPY,WORKAREA=UCBWORK,DEVCLASS=DASD,RANGE=ALL,        X
               UCBAREA=UCBAREA,DYNAMIC=YES
         CLC   CAMVOL,28(3)          VOLSER
         BNE   UCBNEXT

with these:

         UCBSCAN COPY,WORKAREA=UCBWORK,DEVCLASS=DASD,RANGE=ALL,        X
               UCBAREA=UCBAREA,DYNAMIC=YES,VOLSER=CAMVOL
         LTR   R15,R15
         BNZ   NOTMTD

By adding VOLSER=CAMVOL to the UCBSCAN parameters, UCBSCAN only
needs to be executed once per volume instead of once for each UCB
until the volume is found.  All of the looping through UCBs is
done for you internally in a single execution of the macro.  I
didn't notice that feature when I first used the macro. It
doesn't change the results in any way, but it is a better way to
get the UCB.
